# guess-the-number-console
A simple console app game for guessing a number.

A "guess the number" CLI game that requires the player to guess a number between 1 to 20. 

The original python code is from http://inventwithpython.com/chapter4.html

I made the C# version of it that can run in dotnet core as a code practice.
